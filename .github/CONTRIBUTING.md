# Contributing to the repo
This lobby code is **open source**, that means you can suggest changes or new features!! However before you get started doing that please read through the following to understand what we expect of your contributions


## Introduction
Currently the project is written in the language / file format the Workshop uses to parse new logs. We do this for... simplicity, 
however we're considering expanding to [Overwatch Script]( https://github.com/ItsDeltin/Overwatch-Script-To-Workshop) in the future.

For now working with our content is pretty simple

### Install
Steps
- Fork the repo 
- Clone it to your system 
- Join the discord, it's the fastest way to get help, info or make a friend because Aud is lonely: https://discord.com/invite/THmHyAwWDN

If you're unfamiliar with the terms above, you're probably unfamliar with GIT, so I suggest you read here [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/using-git) to learn more 
about github. It's imperitive if you want to contribute to the project!!


### Structure
Files are broken up depnding on their intended purpose, which can be found in the name of the file, for example `Scrim-Auds_StatsFarmer_LIVE_0.0.4.ow` is a version of the stats farmer intended for the live client and scrim usage, whilst `Tournament-Auds_StatsFarmer_PTR_0.0.4.ow` is meant for tournaments held on the PTR client (likely I know lmao). We seperate them because new features may come out on new patches, and so each file may do the same thing but have different syntaxes.

## Making changes
When you're ready to submit your changes for myself and the rest of the crew to view, simply create a pull request titled "[TYPE] Short Name Explaining what your changes do" where TYPE defines what type of modification you're suggesting, anything from a bug fix, new feature or stability change. Take your pick, whatever seems to be the best fit for what you want to do. I or one of the others will review your changes (give it a some time though we're busy people) and get back to you on what we'd like to do with it.

### Note: 
You're not suggesting ways to fix bugs or create features, you're creating them yourself and suggesting we use them.
