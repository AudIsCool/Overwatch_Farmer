# Overwatch_Lobby_Datatracking

This is Aud's code storage repo designed to hold all of Lobby Codes that he likes, modifies or creates. At the end of the day this is to serve as a learning process for both Aud and the rest of the community. Lots of this code wouldn't be possible without reading [Seita's Code](https://twitter.com/Seita_ow) and everyone sitting in my streams helping me through dumb bugs.

Special thanks to [Josh](https://twitter.com/Tschoschi90) and [Aplox](https://twitter.com/_Aplox) for setting me on the analyst path so long ago, and [Jack](https://twitter.com/Jack_di_Quadri) for helping me through the STUPIDEST of errors LOL.
